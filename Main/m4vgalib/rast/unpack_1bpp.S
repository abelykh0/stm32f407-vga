.balign 4

@ 1bpp pixel unpacker using two-color lookup table.
@
@ We unpack pixels in groups of four by copying them into the vector comparison
@ result flags field (GE) of the PSR.  Once loaded there, we can use the sel
@ instruction to look up four pixels at once in the CLUT, once it's been
@ suitably prepared.
@
@ All cycle counts annotated below have been empirically verified.
@
@ Arguments:
@  r0  start of input line containing 1bpp packed pixels (word-aligned)
@  r1  CLUT pointer to two bytes: the zero color and high color.
@  r2  output scan buffer.
@  r3  width of input line in words.

      @ We could load these in one go, yes, but the math below requires the

      @ high bits takes several more cycles than a mere SRAM load.

      @ Because the top 24 bits of each register are clear, we can do this

      @ repeating bit pattern and multiplication are very cheap on this
      @ architecture!
